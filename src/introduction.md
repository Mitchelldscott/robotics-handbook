# Data-driven Design of Autonomous Systems

## Introduction

This book is a consolidation of foundations and algorithms for data-driven
autonomous systems. The material is distilled from key reference texts in
Machine Learning and Robotics. The goal is developing a model-based design
workflow that makes building robots faster and safer.

### Learning Methodology

This first part provides an overview of probability, linear systems and
machine learning, to get a deeper understanding of these topics
readers should use a more in-depth resource. The second part of this book is
meant to be like [rust-by-example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
and provide hands on mini-projects.

## Outline

The book is divided into two primary parts: **Foundations** (
Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics) and **Algorithms** (
specialized applications in Robotics and AI).

### Part I: Foundations (Applied Mathematics & Machine Learning Basics)

This section lays the mathematical groundwork for the rest of the book.

#### A. Mathematics Core

#### B. System Modeling Core

#### C. Deep Learning Core

### Part II: Algorithms and Specialized Applications

This part focuses on applying the foundational math to complex robotics and AI
problems, detailing algorithms used for estimation, mapping, control, and deep
learning architectures.

#### A. Navigation and Localization @@Thrun2005ProbabilisticRobotics

This section focuses on algorithms, typically derived from Bayes filters, for
position estimation, map acquisition and motion planning.

#### B. Advanced Deep Learning @@Goodfellow2016DeepLearning

This section covers modern learning paradigms that use hierarchical
representations, often learned via neural networks with multiple layers,
to model complex patterns in data.

#### C. Reinforcement Learning @@Sutton2018ReinforcementLearning

This section details methods for learning how an agent should take actions in
an environment to maximize a cumulative reward signal.
