# Sample workflow for building and deploying a mdBook site to GitHub Pages
#
# To get started with mdBook see: https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html
#
# Edited by scott.mitchell913@gmail.com to build on all push/PR but only deploy
# from master after a PR merges with master.
# * 10/14/25 - Added linter job to make suggestions on PRs
# * 10/15/25 moved linter to pre-commit
# * 10/15/25 removed artifacts and caching, just rerun the build
